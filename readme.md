## 📋 About

This repository contains my first submission to the [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) competition. The goal is to predict passenger survival based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and other passenger information.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kanitmann01/kaggle_titanic_submission.git
   ```

2. Open and run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook data-cleaning.ipynb
   ```

The notebook contains all the data preprocessing, analysis, and model training steps that led to the final submission.
